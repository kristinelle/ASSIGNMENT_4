In this assignment, we have prepared a report on Industry Talk 2a held on December 28, 2023, focusing on System Development at Credence (TM Subsidiary).

**REFLECTION**

Reflecting on the webex meeting, I've outlined a four-year plan to become a proficient system developer. Active workshop participation, database familiarization, and securing relevant internships are key strategies. Ms. Qistina's experience underscores the significance of cultivating a continuous eagerness to learn, echoing the proverb,
>  "Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere."

 This approach not only showcases skills to employers but also opens doors to diverse career opportunities in system development.
